           I avail the temp restoration, while my husband had his oral prophylaxis. 
           Super bait ni Doc Jay, magaan ang kamay at magaling mag explain. 
           They strictly follow the safety protocols as well, from getting your temp, 
           contract tracing, disinfection and wearing of complete PPE. 
           Will definitely come back for our regular checkups and other dental needs. 
           Thanks again District Smiles!`,
